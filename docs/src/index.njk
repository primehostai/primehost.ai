    - question: Is Pages CMS free?
      answer: Yes, Pages CMS is 100% free, whether you want to use the online version
        or self-host it. It is a simple front-end app with very limited backend
        capabilities, which can run on [Cloudflare
        Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for free. The open-source version
        is MIT licensed; you can host it on your own Cloudflare account for free
        as well.
    - question: Do you only support GitHub?
      answer: "For now, yes. But I've already started looking into adding GitLab and
        Bitbucket. Pull requests and issues are welcome:
        [github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms\
        )."
    - question: Do I have to host Pages CMS on Cloudflare Pages?
      answer: "Not necessarily: Pages CMS is a single-page app with a handful of
        serverless functions to facilitate the OAuth dance with GitHub. You
        could easily run it on Netlify, Vercel, AWS, Render... You would just
        need to make these 3 functions work on your platform of choice:
        [github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms/tree/main/functions/auth](https://githu\
        b.com/pages-cms/pages-cms/tree/main/functions/auth). With that being
        said, Cloudflare has a generous free tier which works great in this
        case."
    - question: Why do you need full access to all of my GitHub repositories?
      answer: >-
        Well, the GitHub API kinda sucks when it comes to OAuth scoping. Pages
        CMS relies on the OAuth App flow, which doesn't allow for granular
        permissions. The alternative would be to use the GitHub App flow
        instead, but:


        - It's a lot more complicated and would require us to store and
        orchestrate a lot more in the backend.

        - Since we need to impersonate users (for things like commits), we
        anyway need to request user tokens, which technically would give us the
        same access as with the OAuth App flow.


        **However, we do not store your GitHub OAuth tokens in the backend**.
        [The serverless functions used to facilitate the OAuth
        login](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms/tree/main/functions/auth)
        pass the OAuth token to the front-end, allowing it to directly
        communicate with the GitHub API.


        And if you still don't trust the online version, [you can deploy your
        own version for free in less than 10 minutes our Cloudflare
        Pages](/docs/development#deploy-on-cloudflare).


        [Do let me know if I got some of this wrong](mailto:hunvreus@gmail.com)
        ([@hunvreus](https://x.com/hunvreus)), and feel free to [suggest
        improvemens in the issue
        queue](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms/issues).
    - question: Why yet another CMS?
      answer: I hear you, but I needed Pages CMS to exist. I love static site
        generators, and while YAML front matter and Markdown aren't terribly
        complicated, editing content and uploading images using GitHub.com or
        Git isn't really user-friendly, especially if you're updating the site
        with a whole team. For that reason, a lot of teams use a headless CMS
        like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi. That works, but it's one more
        dependency and is overkill in most cases. You could also use something
        like Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS). Really cool project, but I've
        never been a fan of the user experience. And most importantly, I wanted
        something as simple as possible. Back in 2018, I had built a lightweight
        CMS ([Jekyll+](https://github.com/hunvreus/jekyllplus)) with the idea of
        getting the CMS set up with a single configuration file. Pages CMS is
        the next iteration of that idea.
    - question: What's the "Pro" plan?
      answer: "I haven't completely figured it out, but there are a few features I'm
        working on that I believe would only be relevant to larger teams or
        professional use. Things like real-time collaboration, advanced media
        management (e.g., image manipulation), or S3 integration. This not only
        requires a lot more work but also hosting costs. If you're interested,
        drop me a line: [hunvreus@gmail.com](mailto:hunvreus@gmail.com)
        ([@hunvreus](https://x.com/hunvreus))."
    - question: Who made this? It sucks!
      answer: "I did: [Ronan Berder](https://ronanberder.com)
        ([@hunvreus](https://x.com/hunvreus)). I'm a half-decent developer, but
        I sure could use some help to make this suck less:
        [github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms\
        )."
