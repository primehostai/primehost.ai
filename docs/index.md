# How it works:

Firstly, you need to connect PrimeHost to your existing communication platforms. PrimeHost will then have access to your online information & guest messages, which will utilise to train your assistant & streamline your operations.

**PMS Connection:**

If you use one of the integrated PMS, you can instantly import your properties & train your Assistant. That's certainly the easiest & most efficient way to start, as you can have everything ready within seconds!

**Booking Channels:**

If you don't use a PMS yet, you can still add PrimeHost directly into your Airbnb or [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) accounts through the PrimeHost Extension.

# Suggested Replies:

Whenever you get a guest message, PrimeHost will create an AI generated reply for you. We will do all the hard job, instead of writing from scratch. You can edit & approve the message, which will instantly reach to your guest. Saves you **TONS** of valuable time!

# Instant AI communication:

We recommend that you use instant communication only after you have familiarised yourself with the AI & feel confident with the replies. You can share your AI Assistant with your guests, using a sharable link or by placing a QR in the property. Your guests will have access to their personal Assistant & can be instantly served 24/7. The best part? Guests **LOVE** to play around with the AI, while you get to relax & save valuable time replying to repetitive questions!
