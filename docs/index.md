# About us:

PrimeHost is an AI-powered guest messaging platform for Hotels & STR managers. It's a startup founded by a property manager and an all-star team of software engineers. Backed by leading investors in the Short Term Rental Industry, our mission is simple: **Make your guest interactions effortless & change the way guest communication works.**

Guest communication is **key** in a successful Hospitality business. If you think about it, it's the **only** way that the property can provide personalized experiences, go the extra mile for their guests, show true commitment & eventually create an emotional bond that will revent into awesome reviews & repetitive customers.

**What's the catch?** Great communication is **extremely time consuming!**

You need to be available 24/7 for your guest's needs, always respond with clear & effective messages, keep a professional tone & of course, instantly handle emergencies. As you grow your successful business & serve lot's of customers, it's inevitable to lose in quality. **What if there was another way?**

Your **All-in-One** AI Assistant, trained on the property to help you serve guests 24/7. In one word, **PrimeHost!**

1.  Learns from the previous conversations of your properties, so it's super easy to set up.
    
2.  Helps with daily questions & inquiries.
    
3.  Sends you emergency alerts & notifications so you can prioritise your time.
    
4.  Reports back to you with real time data insights, the most valuable source available.
    

# How it works:

Firstly, you need to connect PrimeHost to your existing communication platforms (OTAs, Whatsapp etc). PrimeHost will then have access to your online information & guest messages, which will utilise to train your assistant & learn from your previous conversations.

**Suggested replies:**

Whenever you get a guest message, PrimeHost will create an AI generated reply for you. We will do all the hard job for you, instead of writing from scratch. You can edit & approve the message, which will instantly reach your guest. Saves you **TONS** of valuable time!

**Instant communication:**

We recommend that you use instant communication only after you have familiarised yourself with the AI & feel confident with the replies. You can share your AI Assistant with your guests, using a sharable link or by placing a QR in the property. Your guests will have access to their personal Assistant & can be instantly served 24/7. The best part? Guests **LOVE** to play around with the AI, while you get to relax & save valuable time replying to repetitive questions!
