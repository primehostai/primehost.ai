# About us:

PrimeHost is an AI-powered guest messaging platform for Hotels & STR managers. It's a startup founded by a property manager and an all-star team of software engineers. Backed by leading investors in the Short Term Rental Industry, our mission is simple: **Make your guest interactions effortless & change the way guest communication works.**

Guest communication is **key** in a successful Hospitality business. If you think about it, it's the **only** way that the property can provide personalized experiences, go the extra mile for their guests, show true commitment & eventually create an emotional bond that will revent into awesome reviews & repetitive customers.

**What's the catch?** Great communication is **extremely time consuming!**

You need to be available 24/7 for your guest's needs, always respond with clear & effective messages, keep a professional tone & of course, instantly handle emergencies. As you grow your successful business & serve lot's of customers, it's inevitable to lose in quality.

**What if there is another way?**

Integrated with OTAs (Airbnb, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com)) & popular Property Management Systems (Hosthub, Guesty, Hostify, Hostfully), **PrimeHost** empowers you to handle an increasing volume of guest inquiries effortlessly as your business grows.

**Benefits for the property:**

*   **Save time:** Automate responses and free up your schedule
    
*   **Instant responses:** Provide immediate answers to guest inquiries
    
*   **Editable responses:** Customize AI-generated replies to suit specific needs
    
*   **Reduce manual errors:** Ensure accurate information is shared every time
    
*   **Improve guest experience:** Deliver prompt, consistent, and personalized communication
    
*   **Boost SEO:** Reduce response time to enhance your online presence and rankings

# How it works:

Firstly, you need to connect PrimeHost to your existing communication platforms. PrimeHost will then have access to your online information & guest messages, which will utilise to train your assistant & streamline your operations.

**PMS Connection:**

If you use one of the integrated PMS, you can instantly import your properties & train your Assistant. That's certainly the easiest & most efficient way to start, as you can have everything ready within seconds!

**Booking Channels:**

If you don't use a PMS yet, you can still add PrimeHost directly into your Airbnb or [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) accounts. This would require a few manual steps, so we strongly suggest to book a demo.

# Suggested Replies:

Whenever you get a guest message, PrimeHost will create an AI generated reply for you. We will do all the hard job, instead of writing from scratch. You can edit & approve the message, which will instantly reach to your guest. Saves you **TONS** of valuable time!

# Instant AI communication:

We recommend that you use instant communication only after you have familiarised yourself with the AI & feel confident with the replies. You can share your AI Assistant with your guests, using a sharable link or by placing a QR in the property. Your guests will have access to their personal Assistant & can be instantly served 24/7. The best part? Guests **LOVE** to play around with the AI, while you get to relax & save valuable time replying to repetitive questions!
