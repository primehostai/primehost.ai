## What is Pages CMS?

[Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org) is an [Open Source](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms) Content Management System built for static websites (Jekyll, Next.js, VuePress, Hugo, etc).

It allows you to edit your website's content directly on GitHub (and soon GitLab and Bitbucket) via a user-friendly interface.

To use it, you just need to add [a simple configuration file](/docs/configuration) that describes the structure of your content and media.

## How to use Pages CMS?

### Use the online version

The easiest way to get started is to use [the online version of Pages CMS](https://app.pagescms.org). You'll simply need to log in with your GitHub account and [configure your website](/docs/configuration).

This online version runs the latest version from [the public repository](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms). Additionally, we do not keep any information in the backend (OAuth tokens are saved on the client side and the app directly talks to the GitHub API).
