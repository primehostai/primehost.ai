# 1\. Connect your tech stack

Firstly, you need to integrate PrimeHost with your existing communication platforms. PrimeHost will then have access to your online information & guest messages, which will utilise to train your assistant & streamline your operations.

**Starter Plan:**

If you are using the Starter Plan, you can skip this step. You will be able to manually connect your properties and train your AI Assistants, by adding PrimeHost's Extension with Airbnb or Booking.com.

**Pro Plan:**

If you use a Property Management System, you can integrate with PrimeHost & import your properties automatically. That's certainly the easiest & most efficient way to start, as you can have everything ready within seconds!

# 2\. Add a communication method

# 4.Communicate with guests:

**Instant suggestions:**

Whenever you get a guest message, PrimeHost will create an AI generated reply for you. We will do all the hard job, instead of writing from scratch. You can edit & approve the message, which will instantly reach to your guest. Saves you **TONS** of valuable time!

**Auto-pilot:**

We recommend that you use instant communication only after you have familiarised yourself with the AI & feel confident with the replies. You can share your AI Assistant with your guests, using a sharable link or by placing a QR in the property. Your guests will have access to their personal Assistant & can be instantly served 24/7. The best part? Guests **LOVE** to play around with the AI, while you get to relax & save valuable time replying to repetitive questions!
